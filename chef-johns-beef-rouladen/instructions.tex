\begin{enumerate}
  \item Place slices of beef on a work surface, Season both sides with kosher
    salt and pepper. Spread one side with mustard. Place bacon strips on the
    mustard and sprinkle with paprika. Arrange onion slices cross-wise on the
    beef. Then evenly space 3 pickle slices across each slice of beef. Keep
    about an inch of the narrowest end of the beef slice free of toppings to
    facilitate rolling it up.
  \item Roll each slice of meat, beginning from the wider of the two short
    ends, working to keep all ingredients inside the roll. Rolls should be nice
    and tight. Secure the rolls (seam side down) with 3 loops of butcher's
    twine, one in the middle and one at each end. Trim excess string.
  \item Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Cook
    beef, turning and browning well on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove meat
    from pan. Reduce heat to medium-low. Melt butter in the pan; whisk in the
    flour, cooking for about 1 minute. Pour in cold beef broth and whisk
    vigorously to combine. Raise heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce
    begins to thicken, about 1 minute.
  \item Transfer beef rolls to pan along with accumulated juices. Reduce heat
    to very low. Simmer gently, covered, turning rolls every 20 minutes or so,
    until beef is tender, about 1 \nicefrac{1}{2} hours. When the tip of a
    sharp knife can easily be inserted into the beef roll, the meat is done.
  \item Transfer meat to dish to allow it to rest. Raise heat to high and bring
    cooking liquid to a simmer to thicken slightly to make a gravy, about 1
    minute. Serve rouladen with gravy.
