\begin{enumerate}
  \item Season the thin slices of beef with salt and freshly ground pepper. Thinly spread
    mustard on top of each slice.
  \item Divide pieces of bacon, dill pickle slices, and onion slices on one end of each of the
    beef slices.
  \item Roll up slices, tucking the ends in and securing each roll with a skewer, wooden
    cocktail stick, or string.
  \item Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown beef rolls well on all sides. Do
    not crowd rouladen in skillet, or they will not brown nicely. Do in small batches if
    necessary. Add extra butter if needed.
  \item Once all rouladen are well browned, add 1 to 2 cups of hot water, gently stirring up
    browned bits. Place beef rolls, along with any accumulated juices back in the skillet, bring
    to simmer, and cover.
  \item Simmer for about 1\nicefrac{1}{2} hours.
  \item Remove beef roulades. To thicken gravy, make a cornstarch slurry: combine cornstarch in
    a little cold water and stir gently into cooking liquid until slightly thickened.
  \item Season gravy to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. If you wish, add sour cream
    for a nice rich gravy.
  \item Remove strings, wooden picks, or skewers from rouladen.
  \item Ladle gravy over the tender beef rolls to serve.
